#' This notebook contains R code supporting the lecture on count (Poisson) regression
#' from STA303, Summer 2018. The Galapagos Islands Species data are analyzed with a discussion on
#' model assumptions, transformations, overdispersion and offsets. A dose-response model is fit to
#' the salmonella dataset, with a discussion of assumptions, predictor transformations, and overdispersion.
#' Both analyses follow but expand upon those from the Count Regression chapter in Faraway: Extending 
#' the Linear Model with R

### Poisson GLM ###

# Coefficients are all small, but remember their effect is multiplicative now, not additive
# That residual deviance is a bit ridiculous. Is the fit really that bad?
# It could be caused by an outlier. But note that the null deviance is also huge.
# What proportion of the null deviance is explained by the model?
(gala_glm1$null.deviance - deviance(gala_glm1)) / gala_glm1$null.deviance

# So the model does explain much of the deviance
# 
# While in the normal linear model we assumed constant variance, 
# here was are assuming that Var(Y) = E(Y)
# This is a model assumption, and needs to be checked
# Note that the graph in Faraway is labelled incorrectly- it's a log-log plot
