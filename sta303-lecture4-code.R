#' This notebook contains R code supporting the lecture on binomial/logistic regression
#' from STA303, Summer 2018. The classic `orings` dataset is analyzed, along with the Wisconsin
#' Breast Cancer dataset. The former introduces binomial regression, the latter logistic regression.
#' Inference in the former and prediction in the latter are shown, including likelihood ratio tests,
#' true/false positive rates and ROC curves.

# Fit a binomial GLM
# family = binomial ==> binomial regression
# family = poisson ==> poisson regression
# family = gaussian ==> same as lm()
# 
# Standard errors got from likelihood theory
# NOT exact
# They are off in same cases as deviance is off
# ...including binomial regression when m_i are small.
# So, here.
# 
# Residual deviance: deviance as defined in lecture.
# -2log(LRT) between full and SATURATED models
# 
# Null deviance: deviance of the null model,
# So -2log(LRT) between null and residual
#
# Goal was: find a model that fits "as well as"
# saturated model, or at least better than null.
# So, look at (null deviance) - (residual deviance)-
# "amount of deviance explained" by the fitted model
#
# How big is big enough?
#
# (null) - (residual) approx chi squared, df = dim(null) - dim(fitted model)
# Here, this equals 22 - 21 = 1
# This also corresponds to the fact that we fit a model with one parameter
# more than the intercept
#
# Mean of chisquare(n) = n
# Variance = 2n
# So quick check: if model fits as well as saturated,
# Residual deviance won't be more than 2sqrt(2df) away from df
# and if fits better than null, then (null - residual) will be
# more than 2sqrt(2df) from its df

# But don't trust these comparisons, for BINARY data
# The above would be a good thing to do for binomial data with bigger n per observation

# But NOT for BINARY data
# 
# The only reason I showed you any of this in this example is to show you the R code
# for calculating these quantites.
# 
# Now. Can we get a simpler model that fits just as well? Again, stepwise selection based on AIC
# not a great thing for binary regression, but here's how to do it in R. Let's see what happens:

# It's likely that either of these variables would have been fine; e.g. if there are business/scientific
# reasons for wanting to include one over the other, you probably could choose
# 
# What next? Let's look at the actual predicted probabilities. The variables in the model were all pretty skewed, so what do
# we expect the distribution of predicted probabilities to look like?

# True positive rate: TP / (All actual positives)

# 
# Strongly recommend you read the wikipedia article too.
# And then copy this out 100 times.

# We see there is a tradeoff- When we increase the cutoff, we get less false positives, and more false negatives
# Since a positive here means benign, a false positive is classifying a malignant tumour as being benign, which seems worse
# We can plot a parametric curve of the false positives vs true positives for cutoffs ranging from 0 to 1- the ROC curve
# A wide ROC curve means there exists favourable cutoffs, i.e. the model is good
# 
# I won't require you to be able to create the below from scratch like I am here
# But you do need to know how to interpret the below graph.
