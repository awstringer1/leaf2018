#' This notebook is the result of the R code presented during the lectures on one- and
#' two-way ANOVA for STA303 (Methods of Data Analysis II), Summer 2018.
#' 
#' This contains code for analyzing two datasets from Faraway, Linear Models with R (chapters
#' 14 and 15), including creating ANOVA tables from scratch, looking at design matrices, etc.
#' as well as using R's standard modelling API. Also includes many examples of using ggplot, 
#' including making QQ plots from scratch

### Assumptions
### 

# Already looked at standard deviations of groups, and the boxplot
# 
# Normality:
# 
# Two random variables are equal in distribution
# if and only if their cumulative distribution functions
# are equal.
# Easier to compare their INVERSE CDFs- the so-called 
# "quantile functions"
pvc_t %>%
  mutate_at("psize",funs( (. - mean(.)) / sd(.))) %>%
  arrange(psize) %>%
  mutate(q = qnorm(1:n() / (n() + 1))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = q,y = psize)) +
  theme_classic() +
  geom_point() +
  geom_abline(slope = 1,intercept = 0,colour = "red") +
  labs(title = "Normal QQ-plot",
       x = "Theoretical Quantiles",
       y = "Sample Quantiles")

# Some minor deviations, but nothing alarming
# We care more about deviations in the tails than
# in the centre, for testing normality of the residuals (why?)
#
# To get better understanding: recreate the above, but for data
# that is definitely not normally distributed
# E.g. rexp(100)
# or rpois(100)
# or even better: rt(100,df = 5)
# 

### Using linear regression
### 

# Create the model matrix
# Specify the contrasts
# 
# contr.treatment = "Effects coding" from lecture
# This is actually the default
# This happens automatically when you include an intercept in the model
# ...and including an intercept is the default.
X1 <- model.matrix(psize ~ operator,data=pvc_t,contrasts = "contr.treatment")
#View(X1)

t(X1) %*% X1 # Not orthogonal


# To get cell means coding, remove the intercept
# Add a -1 into the formula
X2 <- model.matrix(psize ~ operator -1,data=pvc_t)
#View(X2)

t(X2) %*% X2 # Orthogonal

# Define a standard linear model
# 
lm1 <- lm(psize ~ operator,data=pvc_t)
summary(lm1)

# What are those parameters estimating?
coef(lm1)[1]
coef(lm1)[1] + coef(lm1)[2]
coef(lm1)[1] + coef(lm1)[3]

group_means

# Now fit the null model, and compare them
lmnull <- lm(psize ~ 1,data=pvc_t)
summary(lmnull)

# What is that parameter estimating?
coef(lmnull)
grand_mean$grand_mean

# Compare them. VERY CONFUSING: in R, the anova() function is used to perform a likelihood ratio test
# that two models fit the data equally well. For a standard linear regression (models of class "lm"), it goes one step further
# and performs an F test, accounting for sigma being estimated (this is review from STA302). The F-test for
# comparison of nested linear regression models, when all variables are categorical, is the same as the F-test
# performed in the ANOVA table output by aov()
# 
anova(lmnull,lm1)

# Same F statistic! This is provably true


### Two-Way ANOVA ###

# The PVC data has two factors: operator and resin
# Want to estimate group means of operator, group means of resin, and the interaction between the two
# 
# First need to check: are there data for all combinations of levels?
# Need that to be true in order for the sum of squares decomposition
# as learned in class to hold
# Also, we need replication- more than one datapoint for each combination

pvc_t %>%
  group_by(operator,resin) %>%
  summarize(count = n()) %>%
  print(n = Inf) # Prints the whole table

# What about just by resin?
pvc_t %>%
  group_by(resin) %>%
  summarize(count = n(),stddev = sd(psize)) %>%
  print(n = Inf) # Prints the whole table


# Yes, and furthermore, the design is balanced- each possible combination of factors has an equal number of reps

# Start in the same way, with boxplots, this time of both factors
boxplt1 <- pvc_t %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = operator,y = psize)) +
  theme_classic() +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Boxplot of Particle Size by Operator",

  )

boxplt2 <- pvc_t %>%

  labs(title = "Boxplot of Particle Size by Resin",

       y = "Particle Size"
  )

# Plot these plots on a grid, together
# We use the plot_grid function in the cowplot package
# This is the only function we use from this package,
# so don't load the whole package with library()
# Just reference a single function, with cowplot::
# Still need to install with install.packages("cowplot")
cowplot::plot_grid(boxplt1,boxplt2,nrow=1)

# Unfortunately, only 6 observations per resin level
# Not enough to accurately estimate a variance
# Constant variance assumption? INCONCLUSIVE
# 


# Interaction plots
# You can do these two ways...
# 
# Note: if you're trying to plot a line in ggplot
# and you get an error about the "group aesthetic",
# try setting group=1 in aes()

cowplot::plot_grid(plt1,plt2,ncol=1)

# Does the mean of operator differ among levels of resin?
# Does the mean of resin differ among levels of operator?
# 
# For marginal mean: look at slope of line (different from zero?)
# and whether lines have same vertical location across plots
# 
# For interactions, look at shape of lines. Same across plots?
#
# Even with practice, it is very difficult to accurately assess all three things
# (two marginal means and their interaction) simultaneously, so be careful!


# Do the ANOVA using aov()
twoway_anova <- aov(psize ~ operator + resin + operator:resin,data=pvc_t)
summary(twoway_anova)

# Or, more common:
twoway_anova <- aov(psize ~ operator * resin,data=pvc_t)
summary(twoway_anova)

# Compare the sums of squares to the ANOVA without interactions
twoway_anova_mainonly <- aov(psize ~ operator + resin,data=pvc_t)
summary(twoway_anova_mainonly)

# The sums of squares are the same, but the MSE went down, which makes the F-stats for these
# effects larger, and the corresponding p-values smaller

# Equivalent regression model
lm2 <- lm(psize ~ operator + resin + operator:resin,data=pvc_t)
summary(lm2)

# What are all these parameters estimating?
group_means_int <- pvc_t %>%
  group_by(operator,resin) %>%
  summarize(psize = mean(psize))
group_means_int
# That's the mean of each group. Now, the mean should equal regression intercept plus main effect plus interaction
# For example...
# Mean of operator 1, resin 1 is 36.25
coef(lm2)['(Intercept)'] # Operator 1 and Resin 1 are the reference levels

# Mean of operator 2, resin 2 is 35.35
coef(lm2)['(Intercept)'] + coef(lm2)['operator2'] + coef(lm2)['resin2'] + coef(lm2)['operator2:resin2']

# ...and so on

# Likelihood ratio test
# We can test any hypothesis we want by specifying full model and reduced model.
# Let's first test the interaction hypothesis
# This corresponds to the gamma_ij = 0 for all ij in the linear model we wrote down
# In the equivalent linear model fit here, this corresponds to jointly testing all the operator:resin interaction
# coefficients equalling 0

lm3 <- lm(psize ~ operator + resin,data=pvc_t)
summary(lm3)

anova(lm3,lm2)

# Sum of squares, F and p all the same
#
# Let's test whether resin is useful at all- jointly test main effect of resin = 0 and interaction = 0

lm4 <- lm(psize ~ operator,data=pvc_t)
summary(lm4)

anova(lm4,lm2)
